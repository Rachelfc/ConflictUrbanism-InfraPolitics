## Digital Storytelling with Maps


#### Premise

In this exercise, you will annotate your map in Mapbox. Using the GeoTiff you created in [Tutorial 02](https://github.com/michellejm/ConflictUrbanism-InfraPolitics/blob/master/Tutorials/02_Georeferencing.md) and a timeline of events from the years before and after the plague, you will create an animated timeline telling the story of how the plague started a series of events that amplified the housing shortage in Bombay and gave the colonial powers the opportunity to gain more control over individuals' lives.

#### Notes on the data: 

The map you will be using for this exercise is the 1909 "Island of Bombay" map that you georeferenced in the previous exercise. If you have not already done so please complete the [Georeferencing](https://github.com/michellejm/ConflictUrbanism-InfraPolitics/blob/master/Tutorials/02_Georeferencing.md) exercise. 

You will also need a list of events surrounding the plague. This was compiled from a variety of sources. Some events include links to images as well.
